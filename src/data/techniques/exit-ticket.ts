  description:
    "A brief, structured formative assessment that students complete at the end of class to demonstrate their understanding of the day's learning target.",
  detailedSummary:
    "The Exit Ticket is a formative assessment technique that provides teachers with actionable data about student understanding before students leave the classroom. Unlike traditional homework or extended assessments, an Exit Ticket is concise, focused, and designed to be reviewed quickly—often before the next class period begins. This allows teachers to calibrate their instruction, identify misconceptions, and make real-time adjustments to meet student needs. The technique transforms the end of class from a casual dismissal into a purposeful closing ritual that reinforces the learning target.\n\nEffective Exit Tickets are tightly aligned to a single learning target and are designed to be completed in five minutes or less. The questions require students to demonstrate comprehension, apply a concept, or solve a problem that was the focus of the lesson. Importantly, Exit Tickets should not introduce entirely new material—students should be able to complete them using what they learned in class that day.\n\nTeachers can sort student responses into categories—mastery, partial understanding, significant misconception—and use this data to form flexible groups, re-teach specific concepts, or adjust the pacing of upcoming lessons. The information gathered also serves as valuable evidence of student growth for reporting purposes.\n\nTo make Exit Tickets most effective, establish a consistent routine: students write on a dedicated index card or half-sheet, the teacher collects tickets as students exit, and reviews them before the next class. Over time, the Exit Ticket becomes a routine students take seriously because they know it will inform the next day's instruction—creating a feedback loop where student understanding directly shapes what happens next.",
