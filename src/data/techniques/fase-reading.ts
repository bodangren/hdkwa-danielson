    "A system for student read-alouds that keeps every student reading, listening, and accountable by using short, unpredictable, frequently switched turns.",
  detailedSummary:
    "FASE Reading is a system for student read-alouds that maximizes the value and viability of this crucial classroom activity, building students' fluency in and enjoyment of reading. The acronym FASE reminds teachers of four things to reinforce when students read aloud: Fluency, Accountability, Social, and Expressive. The name also evokes a phase, because the technique is meant to happen in recurring short cycles that yield to other activities and return later. Reading aloud is the most reliable way to assess and build fluency, and the teacher gets a continuous data stream on how well students handle the key texts of the classroom. FASE Reading addresses two recurring objections: leverage concerns, the worry that one reader leaves the rest of the class passive, and self-esteem concerns, the worry that struggling readers will be embarrassed. Leverage is built by making reader identity and turn length unpredictable, so the rest of the class is always reading along. Short durations and quick, consistent transitions reduce transaction costs, keep energy high, and let the teacher cut a struggling reader off cleanly without implicit judgment. Self-esteem concerns are met with culture building, preselected safe sentences, and the teacher's own willingness to stumble. Because everyone reads but no one knows who or for how long, the system protects the weakest readers, who need the most practice, while also creating a shared experience that builds belonging and gives meaning to the text. The core moves are: keep durations unpredictable, keep durations short, keep the identity of the next reader unpredictable, reduce transaction costs, use bridging by reading short segments yourself between students, use spot-check or oral cloze to confirm leverage, and use a placeholder to keep students anchored in the text across brief discussions.",
  actionSteps: [
    "Ask a student to start reading without specifying how long they will read, so the rest of the class cannot tune out until the turn ends.",
    "Keep turns short—often two to four sentences—so every student invests energy in expressive reading and so the teacher can switch readers quickly to sustain engagement.",
    "Select the next reader unpredictably, naming students who have not volunteered as often as those who have, so participation stays universal and leverage stays high.",
    "Transition between readers with a short, consistent phrase such as 'pick up, please' to keep the narrative thread unbroken and protect reading time.",
    "Use bridging by reading a short segment yourself between student readers, modeling expressive reading, resuscitating momentum, or slowing down a passage that needs unpacking.",
    "Use spot-check or oral cloze by leaving a key word out at the end of a sentence and signaling with a tone shift that students should fill in the blank, revealing whether they are following along.",
    "Use a placeholder such as 'hold your place; track me' to keep students anchored in the text across brief discussions, so the return to reading is fast and the transaction cost is nearly zero.",
